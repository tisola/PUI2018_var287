## AirBnb Distribution in New York City
![Alt text](../HW9_ti582/nycbnb.png)  


**CLARITY**:  
The plot is easy to read and understand. The title of the plot is "AirBnb Distribution in New York City". Looking at the data points on the plot, the title of the plot is applicable and makes sense. There are no axes, which is acceptable in this case given that it is a map plot. In my opinion, the map makes good usage of minimalism to show just the data that is needs to show and still be clear. 

**ESTHETIC**:  
The esthetic of the plot is applicable to the purpose of the plot. The plot is trying to show the distribution of AirBnb prices in New York City. The usage of a legend is beneficial and shows what colors correspond to which prices. The colors used are effective and are easy to see and intepret. 

**HONESTY**:  
In my opinion, the plot is displaying the data in an honest way and is not deforming it.

**IMPROVEMENTS**:  
We have learned from Dr. Bianco that including a caption for every plot is important. There is no caption included for this plot so my recommendation would be to include a caption that explains what the plot is showing, what trends (if any) are present, and why it is important. I would also suggest adding the boundaries for each borough, because currently, while Manhattan is clear, it is unclear where the boundary is between Queens and Brooklyn.
